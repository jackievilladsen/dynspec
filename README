This git repository contains code written to create dynamic spectra from
CASA data, then manipulate and display those dynamic spectra. It also
contains sub-directories with other scripts used to create figures for
Villadsen et al. papers that use those scripts. The code has not been
prepared to be user-friendly but I am making it available for the sake
of transparency.  Readers are welcome to use or adapt it as they wish,
but I recommend contacting me via email (jackievilladsen@gmail.com,
jvillads@nrao.edu) if you are looking for code to do something in particular
and I'd be glad to provide advice or an excerpt of code so you don't have to
sort through the whole git repository.

If you do copy or adapt code from here, and use it in preparing a publication,
please cite first the Villadsen et al. paper that used this code: "Ultra-Wideband Detection
of 22 Coherent Radio Bursts on Active M Dwarfs" in ApJ (in revision as of
2018 Sep 29, arXiv link available soon).
